description: Turn a chosen problem and broad direction into shared decisions and an implementation-ready spec. Use when the user wants to clarify behavior or scope, stress-test an idea, align before implementation, or produce a spec.

# Shape Idea

This skill requires `project-knowledge`, `add-stack-context`,
`explain-visually`, and `build-prototype`. Before the first question, confirm
each one is installed. When one is missing, stop and report it with its
install command, `npx skills@latest add toy-crane/skills --skill <name>`,
using the project's package manager runner where it pins one.

## Keep alignment separate from delivery

Shaping settles decisions; implementation applies them. Do not change product
source, configuration, or dependencies, even for an edit you plan to revert. A
changed line mixes alignment with delivery and leaves unreviewed code behind.

Write only to the spec folder, glossary, decision contracts, the root
`DESIGN.md` and its read route that recording a screen decision updates, and
vendor agent context. Run every experiment, benchmark, and preview in a scratch directory
outside the working tree. If no experiment can answer a question, record an
assumption and its risk. If code contradicts the user or a decision, surface the
conflict; do not fix the code.

Check the working tree when you start and again before writing `spec.md`.
Revert what this session changed outside the allowed paths and keep only what
you learned. Leave uncommitted work that predates the session alone.

## Ground decisions in project truth

Before the first question, invoke `project-knowledge` with the problem and
direction being shaped and the terms and choices they touch; it hands back
the confirmed definitions of those terms, the decision contracts that apply,
and the path of each `GLOSSARY.md` entry or `docs/decisions/<subject>.md`
file it writes. Apply those throughout the session, and route each term that
gets resolved and each decision that settles during shaping back through it
the same way.

Read root `PRODUCT.md` when it exists before settling the work unit. Treat it as
the current app-level premise, use only the product constraints relevant to the
selected work, and surface any mismatch that would require changing that
premise. Do not create, edit, or copy the whole file into the work-unit spec.
Missing `PRODUCT.md` does not block shaping.

Resolve what available evidence can answer before asking the user.

Ground any conclusion about a third-party package or tool in evidence of how it
actually behaves — its own source, documentation, releases, and maintainer
statements — and confirm it against this project's versions in a scratch copy
before building on it or working around it. Record what was checked, what fell
short, and the upstream change that would reopen the decision.

When a decision selects a framework or hosted service, invoke
`add-stack-context` with that one technology, the decision that selected it,
and the project evidence behind it, so it audits only that technology rather
than the whole stack. It owns discovery, source acceptance, installation, and
live vendor-document routing for it, and hands back the technology's
accounting outcome together with the paths of the skills it installed and the
agent-instruction lines it added or changed; shaping resumes once that is in
hand and records the outcome in the spec.

## Present one decision at a time

Present a concrete candidate for the user to correct, using the lightest medium
that makes the decision judgeable.

- Decide an inexpensive, reversible choice when a mismatch is unlikely or easy
  to detect; state it as an overridable assumption, never a project decision
  contract.
- For a branch expensive to get wrong, ask exactly one question about one fact,
  value, or choice. Include a recommended answer and concise reason, then wait.
- If a proposed decision depends on information only the user can know, state
  that information and ask whether it applies. Verify any condition you can
  check yourself.
- For a choice judged by looking or trying, inspect the current surface as
  evidence and show it only when the decision requires a baseline comparison.
  Render a candidate or two or three controlled variants, verify the relevant
  states, and wait for the user's reaction. Invoke `build-prototype` for a
  whole-surface review or a temporary comparison for the user's specific
  situation. Scope that decision layer independently of product screen count:
  pass only the question and context needed to judge it, integrate
  the chosen result into the existing prototype when present, discard the
  comparison, and resume shaping. If no sufficient renderer is available, defer
  the decision and record the resulting risk.
- When a flow, state model, or relationship has multiple branches, transitions,
  or links, render one diagram before a downstream decision. Ask at most one
  question about its unresolved part and wait. Keep a linear structure that fits
  in one sentence in prose.
- When the user asks for an explanation rather than a decision, invoke
  `explain-visually` with the question and the sources it concerns; it hands
  back the rendered explanation, after which shaping resumes.

A choice is settled when the user confirms it or it is made under authority the
user explicitly delegated for that class of decision. It becomes a project
decision contract only when future work should reuse it, its rationale prevents
reasonable re-litigation, and it came from a real trade-off; feature-local
choices stay in the spec.

Skip review only for an already confirmed pattern, routine presentation details,
or explicit user delegation. Record the reason and treat only agent-judged
reasons as assumptions.

## Write the product contract

Stop asking questions when every implementation-relevant decision is resolved
or explicitly deferred; do not wait for the user to declare completion.
Translate confirmed product-change requests into required behavior. Keep cheap
agent-chosen defaults as overridable assumptions; ask about or explicitly defer
consequential unsettled behavior and record its possible impact as a remaining
risk. Never record a deferred branch as a settled constraint. Interim behavior
the product needs while it stays open is written under the deferred point,
naming the decision that replaces it; where the contract states that behavior
again so it can be built and tested, mark it interim there too.

When ready for implementation, write `docs/specs/<slug>/spec.md` as the stable
product contract, creating the kebab-case folder when needed. Include the
user-visible outcomes, approved scope, observable acceptance criteria, settled
constraints and rationale, assumptions, off-limits areas and why, deferred
points, and remaining risks. Record behavior and decisions without predicting
files, functions, code structure, technical layers, or implementation steps.
Carry only applicable app-level constraints from `PRODUCT.md`; keep the file as
their canonical product context rather than duplicating its full contents.

When this work depends on another spec folder finishing first, add a
`Blocked by: docs/specs/<other>/` line beside the linked sources, one per
folder, with that exact English label whatever language the spec uses. It is
repository information that later coordination reads, so write it whether or
not an issue tracker is set up.

When the repository's `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` carries an `## Issue tracker`
section and the user names an existing issue this work comes from, add an
`Issue: <tracker>:<id>` line beside the linked sources in the ID form its
convention records. Write it only from an ID the user gave; never search the
tracker by title to find one, and never create an issue while shaping. Without
the section, or without a known ID, write no such line.

Link the approved `prototype.html` when one exists and each decision contract
this work depends on, so implementation loads them as required sources instead
of judging them optional. Preserve a link an earlier `build-prototype` close-out
already wrote. Say what each linked source governs here, and leave its own
rules, thresholds, and screen compositions in that source instead of copying
them back into a constraint the spec states; keep the links beside the
contract's fields rather than turning them into one.

## Make the shaped change judgeable

Close by summarizing the complete product contract and making the approved
product change understandable and judgeable from the user's point of view. The
user should not need to inspect the spec or ask separately what the resulting
experience will look like.

Choose the explanation and approved visual evidence that best reveal the
intended change and its important downstream consequences. Give particular
attention to consequences that are easy to miss when reviewing only the
surface being changed.

Distinguish the intended experience from implemented evidence, keep the
close-out consistent with the product contract, and do not prompt for another
action.
