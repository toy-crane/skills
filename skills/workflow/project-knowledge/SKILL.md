description: "Maintain a project's canonical terms and settled decisions that future work should reuse, and record follow-ups a session discovers but does not resolve. Use when project-specific terms are being clarified, when a choice that may constrain future work is being considered or settles, including during planning, or when a session applies a temporary workaround whose root cause stays open or observes an out-of-scope defect with evidence. Do not use for simple definitions, routine implementation details, or carrying out an already-settled decision."

# Project Knowledge

Resolve unclear project terms and preserve settled decisions so future work uses
the same language and does not re-litigate the same trade-offs.

## Resolve terms

Read `GLOSSARY.md` when it exists.

- Resolve vague, overloaded, or conflicting project terms with the user.
- Stress-test unclear relationships between domain concepts with concrete
  edge-case scenarios.
- When a term is resolved, create `GLOSSARY.md` if needed and update it
  immediately using the [glossary template](./templates/glossary.md).
- Keep only project terms and their current definitions in `GLOSSARY.md`.

## Preserve decisions

When `docs/decisions/README.md` exists, read it and load only the subject files
relevant to the current work.

Record a project decision only when it is all of the following:

1. **Settled**: the choice is no longer a proposal. The user confirmed the
   outcome, or it was chosen under authority the user explicitly delegated for
   this class of decision.
2. **Reusable**: future work is likely to face the same question and should
   reuse this answer unless its reconsideration conditions are met.
3. **Non-obvious**: without its rationale, future work could reasonably reopen
   the question or choose differently.
4. **A real trade-off**: plausible alternatives existed, and preserving why
   they were rejected prevents the same evaluation from recurring.

Require evidence that a choice was intentional before treating it as settled.
Implementation or lack of objection alone is insufficient.

For each qualifying decision, use the
[decision contract template](./templates/decision-contract.md) to create or
update its single subject file in `docs/decisions/`. Preserve only the context
future work needs to apply the decision without repeating the original analysis.

## Keep the design entry current

Root `DESIGN.md` is where design work starts: the project's values, the shared
components in use, rejected UI patterns, and a map from each visible element to
the decision contract that owns it. Contracts stay the source of every rule;
`DESIGN.md` only points at them, so copy no rule text, rationale, or threshold
into it.

A screen contract decides how something looks or behaves on screen: color, text
role, spacing, icon, component, copy, loading, disabled, or error state, or
sheet, toast, or header behavior. Contracts about repository mechanics, data
ownership, review process, or deployment are not screen contracts and leave
`DESIGN.md` alone. A contract that sets UI review criteria may be a link target
for a rejected pattern but is not a map element.

When you create a screen contract or change which elements one covers, update
`DESIGN.md` in the same change using the
[design entry template](./templates/design.md):

- Add or correct one map line for each element the contract owns.
- Add one rejected-pattern line for each pattern the contract rejects that an
  agent would otherwise write in UI code. Process alternatives, such as
  enforcing a rule through lint, stay only in the contract.
- Make sure both agent clients are told that work which builds or reviews
  screens reads `DESIGN.md` first. Put that line in `AGENTS.md`, creating the
  file when it is missing, and also in `CLAUDE.md` when it exists and does not
  already load `AGENTS.md`. Skip a file that already carries a line with that
  meaning.

When `DESIGN.md` does not exist yet, create it at that moment:

- Map every existing screen contract in the decision index, not only the
  current one, and list their rejected UI patterns.
- Copy values and shared components once from the project's token source and
  shared component directory, naming each source path in its section. Omit a
  section whose source does not exist.

After creation, leave the values and components sections to the work that
changes their named sources. When an existing `DESIGN.md` uses another layout,
add lines where it already keeps them instead of reformatting it. A project
with no screen contract has no `DESIGN.md`.

## Record follow-ups

Record a follow-up when a workaround applied in this session is temporary and
its root cause stays open, or when an out-of-scope defect or suspected cause is
observed with evidence. Work that closed inside the session, a guess without
evidence, and a defect already fixed in the current change do not qualify.

Write each qualifying item at the moment of discovery to its own
`docs/follow-ups/<slug>.md` using the
[follow-up template](./templates/follow-up.md), naming the slug for the symptom.
An item must let a later session act without this conversation. Reporting the
discovery in conversation does not preserve it.

A follow-up records an open question, not a settled decision, so it does not
enter `GLOSSARY.md` or a decision contract until its outcome settles on its own
terms. Delete the file when the work ships or the item is promoted into a spec
folder.

## Protect project truth

- If code conflicts with the user's statement, `GLOSSARY.md`, or a relevant
  decision contract, surface the mismatch instead of choosing silently. Code
  shows current behavior, but not whether that behavior was intentional.
- A request to align documentation with code does not by itself confirm the
  decision the code implies.
- If relevant sources disagree about a settled decision, leave project
  knowledge unchanged until the intent is explicitly clarified.
- Treat a term or decision as preserved only after its target file is updated.
